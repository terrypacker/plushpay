# PlushPay
Beta PlushPay Currency Matching Platform

The basis for this work is to create a *fee-free trading platform for currency exchange*.  The system works by combining groups of traders from many currencies into a chain that ensures no money ever leaves the source country.  It also optimizes the amounts that can be gained by triage and keeps that as profit for PlushPay.

# Simple Example:

- Exchange rate is .9 USD = 1.0 AUD
- Trader 1 in USA wants $10 AUD
- Trader 2 in Australia wants $4 USD
- Trader 3 in Australia wants $5 USD

- Trader 1 pays PlushPay USA $9 USD
- Trader 2 pays PlushPay Australia $4.44 AUD
- Trader 3 pays PlushPay Australia $5.56 AUD

Match all traders so that in the USD PlushPay account there is $9USD for Traders 2 and 3 while there is $10AUD in the Australia PlushPay account for Trader 1.

Triage opportunity comes in when the traders submit trades over time while the rates are changing.
